# LoL The Spire — deployed test builds

This directory is a versioned GitHub Pages test archive.

## Convention

Each deployed build gets a new immutable subfolder under `lol-the-spire/` rather than replacing the previous deployment.

Current build:

- `lane-warden-m0-v0.1.6/` — Lane Warden M0 targeted input-remediation regression for `LW-0A-003`. It fixes cancellation cleanup so `pointercancel` can never commit a Commander tap/order and validates cancellation safety with a 3-minute interaction-heavy Stress regression.

Prior builds:

- `lane-warden-m0-v0.1.5/` — `DIAG-PC-001`; short pointer lifecycle/capture diagnostic. It established that observed active cancellations were interrupted pans with clean recovery and exposed the latent cancel-as-tap path in the frozen core.
- `lane-warden-m0-v0.1.4/` — `LW-0A-002`; **SUPERSEDED BEFORE EXECUTION** after diagnostic evidence refined the pointer-cancel failure model.
- `lane-warden-m0-v0.1.3/` — `LW-0A-001`; formal result **FAILED** on its preregistered raw pointer-cancel criterion. Its 20-minute renderer/channel stability and performance evidence remains applicable to the unchanged rendering/simulation path.
- `lane-warden-m0-v0.1.2/` — persistent exploratory instrumentation over the original battlefield core.
- `lane-warden-m0-v0.1.1/` — first real-device exploratory Web/PWA channel spike.

When a newer build is deployed, add a new subfolder and update `lol-the-spire/index.html` to mark it current. Preserve prior folders for regression testing and comparison unless explicitly retired.
